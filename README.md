# Analyzing the Global Luxury Resale Market  
## Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project analyzes over 25,000 global luxury resale listings to understand the key factors influencing resale pricing and value retention. The objective was to uncover structured pricing drivers across brands, product conditions, seller credibility, and geographic regions to support data driven marketplace strategy.

## Business Problem
Luxury resale platforms experience significant pricing variability across brands, categories, and sellers. Without clear visibility into pricing drivers, inconsistencies can impact customer trust, seller performance, and revenue optimization.

This analysis aims to answer:
- What factors most strongly influence resale price?
- How do brand strength and product condition affect value retention?
- Are there geographic or seller driven pricing patterns?

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 25,000+ global resale listings, including:

- Brand and product category  
- Product condition rating  
- Seller credibility indicators  
- Geographic location  
- Listing price  

Data was cleaned, standardized, and validated prior to analysis.
